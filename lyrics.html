    Yeah
    Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting
    This song is dedicated to you
    Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
    Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
    Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
    Swear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my-
    Said I wanna die, yuh
    No, I'm not alright, yuh
    I might start a riot
    I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
    So what's up? What you say?
    Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
    Tired of the fuckin' hate
    Stackin' cheese all on my plate
    So outside of my misery, I think I'll find
    A way of envisioning a better life
    For the rest of us, the rest of us
    There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us
    Okay, she keep cryin', she keep cryin' every single night
    Said I wanna die, yuh
    No, I'm not alright, yuh
    I might start a riot
    I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh
    So what's up? What you say?
    Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
    Tired of the fuckin' hate
    Stackin' cheese all on my plate</pre>
